======================

##Mini50

This layout is designed to be the smallest staggered keyboard to build into a lapboard. This use-case is geared towards casual use while watching television.

## Quantum MK Firmware

For the full Quantum feature list, see [the parent readme.md](/docs/README.md).

## Building

Use the command `make handwired/mini50`


<!-- ### Default

To build with the default keymap, simply run `make`.

### Other Keymaps

To build the firmware binary hex file with a keymap just do `make` with `keymap` option like:

```
$ make keymap=[default|jack|<name>]
```

Keymaps follow the format **__keymap.c__** and are stored in folders in the `keymaps` folder, eg `keymaps/my_keymap/` -->
